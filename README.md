# reinsbot

This bot was created for the GOT: Conquest mobile game, specifically to work with Discord.

The idea is that you can register reinforcements with it and see reinforcements for seats of power.

It is currently in development.

Setup the database for the first time by calling any of the '!addreins' commands.
